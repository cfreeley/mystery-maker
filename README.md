Murder Mystery Dinner Party Generator and Hosting and Attending Mobile-first Web App

##Welcome, Detective!
We’re designing a new web application to make the process of hosting a murder mystery party less of a hassle. It will help you and your guests keep better track of all the clues and information and focus on having a good time and solving the murder.

###Informed Consent:
We are conducting a study to find out what people think about this. We will not record or publish any information with your name. This is for a course we’re taking in Human-Computer Interaction from Prof. Sprague in the College of Computer and Information Science. Your participation is voluntary and you can stop anytime and ask that your data not be used. It should only take about 20 minutes. Can you help us out with this?

###Introduction:
Our murder mystery application has two parts. The first is the configuration of the party, during which the host sets up the details and invites the guests. The second is the app during the party, which keeps track of the guests’ clues, evidence, and notes, sending them real-time to their phones rather than having to deal with assorted papers. The purpose of today’s session is for you to test both aspects of the application, helping us figure out what improvements we need to make it more user-friendly. 
We will have you set up a sample party and then go through two in-party tasks that cover the main interactions that our users will have while attempting to solve the murder. Your job is to tell us what parts of the interface are easy to understand, what parts are not, and how we can change features to make them more intuitive and work how you’d expect them to work. We will also be giving you a sample guest invitation, which will give you more information on the sample party you are testing and specific instructions on how guest participation works.
Keep in mind that we’re testing the interface, not you, so any issues or confusing bits are not your fault. They are actually helpful to us and signal the things we need to change. Since the application is still being developed, nothing is set in stone, so feel free to call out any detail that you think should be enhanced or changed. Any feedback or questions you have are invaluable to us, much like Dr. Watson is invaluable to Sherlock Holmes. 

###Startup Instructions:
We will ask you to view this app from a normal laptop or desktop browser for the set-up task, and from a mobile browser for the party tasks. We are hosting our application as a website, and the in-party features are designed especially for mobile phones, rather than through a specific app or by viewing a small version of a desktop website. This means that using it is as simple as following a link on a web-capable device. If you do not have access to a smartphone, the developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+I on Chrome, Ctrl+Shift+C on Firefox) have the option to view a website as if from a mobile screen. When you are ready to begin the study, follow the first link listed below and read **Task I**.

###Tasks:
#####Task I: 
Set up a party from an existing template.
#####Task IIa: 
Read the sample party invitation below to get an overview of the context for the following tasks. When you have finished, follow the second link below on a smartphone and begin **Task IIb**.
#####Task IIb: 
You are in the midst of your murder investigation. In the quest to complete your top objective, you have figured out that another guest, Thibault, is willing to trade the necessary information for a security clearance code. Complete this trade. 
#####Task III: 
The party is coming to an end soon, and the murderer will be confessing soon. You think you know who did it, so submit your accusation.

###Sample Invitation:
Greetings, Tina Tenneson! 
As one of Chromesville’s most important citizens, you have been invited to a fundraiser for the upcoming presidential campaign of Chromesville’s one and only Mayor Tuck. The event will be held at the home of the local captain of hovercar industry, Thomas Torbeck, on May 17th, 2054, and will feature dinner, networking, and murder!

#####About your character:
You are Tina Tenneson, chief investigative reporter and founder of *Zwiastunem Wolności*, the sole remaining independent newspaper in Chromesville. You are one of two reporters invited to cover the story of the fundraiser, but you are also following up on an anonymous tip that the Mayor Tuck administration has a history of corruption. Your paper’s profits have been declining for several years, but if the tip holds true and you are the first to break the story, you will have nothing to worry about. You may even influence the outcome of the election! However, to complicate things, the tip was submitted directly to you, rather than *Zwiastunem Wolności*. Does that mean that it’s a trap? Or that the lengths of the corruption have infiltrated the ranks of your own publication? It remains to be seen, but you are willing to do anything for a story, even if it means going renegade. 

#####About the party:
When you arrive, log in to your party with the code A1B4E. This will give you access to all of your information for the duration of the party, including guests, objectives and evidence. Each guest will receive somewhat different information as befits their role, and it is your job to complete all of your objectives and solve the murder through any means possible. Make sure you know your character’s role and knowledge inside and out and prepare to both negotiate and hide information from the other guests. As the party approaches, hone your acting and sleuthing chops, get ready your best futuristic attire, and cross your fingers that your wits will keep you alive until the party’s end!
